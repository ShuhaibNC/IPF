# IPF - IP Finder

## A simple android mobile application to find IPv4 ap0, wlan0 IP Address without connecting into a WiFi Network

I didn't find any application in Playstore that retrieves ap0 or wlan0 IPv4 address without connecting into WiFi network, So i made this application

## For Termux
For Termux users, You don't need this application.
You just simply have to run
`ifconfig`
