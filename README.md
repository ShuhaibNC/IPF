# IPF - IP Finder

**IPF - IP Finder is a simple android mobile application to find IPv4 ap0, wlan0 IP Address without connecting into a WiFi Network**

I didn't find any application in Playstore that retrieves `ap0` or `wlan0` IPv4 address without connecting into WiFi network, So i made this application.

## For Termux
For Termux users, You don't need this application.
Just simply run
`ifconfig`

### AIDE Support
This source code supports AIDE, You just need to install AIDE from Playstore or any Sources, then clone this repo.
